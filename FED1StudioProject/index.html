                            Founded in 2000 by Jacob Roelfosz, West Gate Accounting Trainers has come a long way from its beginnings in Liberty Missouri. When Jacob first started out, his passion for teaching people a new subject without having to spend outrageous amounts at a college drove him to start their own business.
